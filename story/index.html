            Oh, why not? I've always heard this is one of the best bookstores in the world.
            I'd love to go in. I think they have the original manuscripts of Harry Potter inside.
        </p>
        <div class='fade-in-class'>
            Are you sure you don't want to go in?
            <p><button onclick=changeDisp(this) parent='no' next='no2'>Yeah, I'm sure</button>
            <button onclick=changeDisp(this) parent='no' next='five'>You know what.. Let's go in</button></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id='five'>
        <p>
            You enter the bookstore. There are many insanely good books here and most are original. You are
            in shock. You are so glad you went in, but in the back of your head, you think... maybe
            you shouldn't have. You are told the original manuscripts of Harry Potter are downstairs.
        </p>
        
        <div class='fade-in-class'>
            <p>
                Do you go down the stairs?
            </p>

                <button onclick=changeDisp(this) parent='five' next='no3'>Nope. Absolutely not. Yeah, we're not doin that</button>
            </div>

    </div>

    <div id='no2'>
        <p>
            There is a certain mysteriousness to this bookstore but you cannot describe it. You really do not want to enter.
        </p>
        <p>
            What's wrong with just entering? I'm here too and I'm going to go in...
        </p>
        <button onclick=changeDisp(this) parent='no2' next='five'>You're right. Let's go</button>
    </div>

    <div id='no3'>
        <p>
            Seriously you should go down...
        </p>
        <button onclick=yes(this) parent='no3' next='six'>No</button>
        <button onclick=yes(this) parent='no3' next='six'>No</button>
    </div>

    <div id='six'>
        <p>
            Haha now you can quarantine here.. with all the books. I will bring food of course.
